# Our Mission
SafetyNational Documentation for our public facing apis

#  Code Of Conduct

Before we dive into learning about the APIOPs tool we would like to share some guidance on how to navigate the associated Github repo as you learn your way around the tool:
- Always use the latest [release](https://github.com/Azure/apiops/releases) which includes the latest features and bug fixes
- Please use the [issues](https://github.com/Azure/apiops/issues) section to report any issues that you encounter as well as any requested features that you would like to raise to the development team. Always remember to close your issues when its gets resolved 
- Remember to subscribe to this repo (at least subscribe to be notified about new releases) to stay in the loop as we are always adding new features and squashing these pesky bugs
- Please read this guide before opening any issues
- This is an open source project and hence we are always accepting contributions from the community so make sure you fork and submit your PRs. We take them seriously and they help us make the tool better

#  Versions
Please note that starting with release V.3.0.0 we changed the way the updates to the system get delivered. Thus when reading the docs you will notice that there are some sections that are designated with the <= V.3.0.0 and >= V.3.0.0 suffixes to distinguish between the old and the new update delivery methodology. We recommend switching to the new methodology whenever possible as it greatly simplifies fetching the latest version of the code. 

## Old method (version < 3.0.0)
